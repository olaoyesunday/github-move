# How to contribute to Testing
Did you find a bug?

Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in sundav soft, and instead to refer to our security policy.
Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

<strong>Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?</strong>

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution.

Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

Before submitting, please read the Contributing to sundav soft guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally not be accepted (read more about our rationales behind this decision).

#### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?
Suggest your change in the our mailing list and start writing code.

Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### Do you have questions about the source code?
Ask any question about how to use sundavsoft our forum.

#### Do you want to contribute to the Rails documentation?
Please read Contributing to the sundavsoft Documentation.
Sundavsoft is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join the team!
